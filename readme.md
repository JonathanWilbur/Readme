Readme is a command line tool for reading GitHub-flavored Markdown, which is
intended to be a replacement for `man` pages. The author's aspiration is to
replace `man` pages with equivalent markdown pages.

## Usage

The command line syntax is simply `readme`, followed by options (if you want to
use them), followed by the name of the topic, program, or file you want to learn
about. The syntax signature is:

> readme [options ...] topic|program|file

## Compile and Install

As of right now, there are no build scripts, since the source is a single file,
but there will be build scripts in the future, just for the sake of consistency
across all similar projects.
